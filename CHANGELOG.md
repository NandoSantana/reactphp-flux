# Changelog

## 1.0.0 (2018-05-25)

*   First stable release, following SemVer

    I'd like to thank [@geertvanbommel](https://github.com/geertvanbommel),
    a fellow software architect specializing in database batch processing and
    API development, for sponsoring the first release! ðŸŽ‰
    Thanks to sponsors like this, who understand the importance of open source
    development, I can justify spending time and focus on open source development
    instead of traditional paid work.

    > Did you know that I offer custom development services and issuing invoices for
      sponsorships of releases and for contributions? Contact me (@clue) for details.
